RecursiveRouteChoice
====================
RecursiveRouteChoice is an efficient  Python implementation of the recursive logit model for
route choice. This kind of model was first developed in
`Fosgerau, Frejinger & Karlstrom 2013 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trb.2013.07.012>`_

This implementation contains both prediction and estimation models. `See the docs
for a more detailed introduction <https://m-richards.github.io/RecursiveRouteChoice>`_. Here is a
quick start overview.

Installation
------------
The current most direct method of installation is to clone the repository and install using pip::

       pip install -r requirements.txt

Note that (currently) on windows the 2004 update has broken some interactions with OpenBLAS. To
avoid any problems it is recommended to use conda, which will use MKL BLAS and avoid any issues::

    conda install --file (cat requirements.txt)

Note that there are no direct problems related to this in the code but
pip will install numpy 1.19.4 by default, which will
immediately crash to warn about this. Reverting to numpy 1.19.3 "fixes" this in that the warning
isn't triggered, but other code which does require on the broken functionality may silently fail.

..
    Currently one can install from the repository directly using pip::

       pip install git+https://github.com/m-richards/RecursiveLogit.git


It is recommended to use some kind of virtual environment to avoid conflicting package versions.
There is also a :code:`requirements_strict.txt` which explicitly specifies package versions. This
will likely contain less up to date versions, but should always work regardless of future
api changes of the dependencies.

Example Usage
-------------
Note the tntp file here is not included in the repository data, download separately from
`TransportationNetworks <https://github.com/bstabler/TransportationNetworks>`_
::

    import numpy as np
    from recursiveRouteChoice.data_loading import load_tntp_node_formulation
    from recursiveRouteChoice import RecursiveLogitModelPrediction, ModelDataStruct, \
    RecursiveLogitModelEstimation, optimisers

    # DATA
    network_file = "SiouxFalls_net.tntp"
    node_max = 24  # from network file

    data_list, data_list_names = load_tntp_node_formulation(
        network_file, columns_to_extract=["length", "capacity"], sparse_format=False)

    distances = data_list[0]

    incidence_mat = (distances > 0).astype(int)
    network_struct = ModelDataStruct(data_list, incidence_mat)

    beta_sim = np.array([-0.8, -0.00015])
    model = RecursiveLogitModelPrediction(network_struct,
                                          initial_beta=beta_sim, mu=1)
    print("Linear system size", model.get_exponential_utility_matrix().shape)

    orig_indices = np.arange(0, node_max, 1)
    # dest_indices = (orig_indices + 5) % node_max
    dest_indices = np.arange(0, node_max, 1)  # sample every OD pair
    obs_per_pair = 1
    print(f"Generating {obs_per_pair * len(orig_indices) * len(dest_indices)} obs total per "
          f"configuration")
    seed = 42
    obs = model.generate_observations(origin_indices=orig_indices, dest_indices=dest_indices,
                                      num_obs_per_pair=obs_per_pair, iter_cap=2000, rng_seed=seed)

    optimiser = optimisers.ScipyOptimiser(method='l-bfgs-b')
    beta_est_init = [-5, -0.00001]
    model_est = RecursiveLogitModelEstimation(network_struct, observations_record=obs,
                                              initial_beta=beta_est_init, mu=1,
                                              optimiser=optimiser)

    beta = model_est.solve_for_optimal_beta(verbose=False)

    print(f"beta expected: [{beta_sim[0]:6.4f}, {beta_sim[1]:6.4f}],"
                  f" beta_actual: [{beta[0]:6.4f}, {beta[1]:6.4f}]")
